# Danes against censorship

Danish internet is "blocked" by DNS filtering, censorship

We will try to collect some information here.




# Redbarnet / Save the Children protests

Yes, we protest against the danish chapter of Save the Children.

We RECOMMEND helping children, but do so through other channels!

Why?

Redbarnet / Save the Children Denmark was part of the partnership responsible
for implementing the first DNS filter in Denmark, and have decided to keep
up appearances - even though it does NOT help anything.

Aside; Henrik Kramsh√∏j and other held a meeting with key personnel from
this organisation, and they admitted the "blocking" is mostly Public Relations.

Today in Denmark (and other European countries) we see internet filtering
being proposed and implemented, using the same arguments as always
- some call these the Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Horsemen_of_the_Infocalypse

"There does not appear to be an exact definition for who the Horsemen are, but
they are usually described as terrorists, drug dealers, pedophiles, and
organized crime. "

# I dont agree with this!!!!11111

Fine, dont - but I am happy that you noticed, and hopefully you will be
thinking about where your donated money to charities help the most!

We certainly think it is important to support, and do so in the most efficient
way possible!
